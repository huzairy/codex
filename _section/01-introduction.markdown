What you see here is a single page HTML file generated by the help from [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), hosted on GitHub, which I refer as The Codex. The beauty of single page document: fast, can be viewed offline, and you can search anything in real-time using the built-in browser's search function.

If you have any feedback, just send it through [GitHub's issue](https://github.com/huzairy/codex/issues). I will try my best to respond.
